# Project Deep Clean
#### For Samsung Galaxy S8 G950FD AQL5 
##### And probably other variants.

------------


Since Samsungs TouchWiz ROM is extremely bloated with some some useful features. Project Deep Clean is aimed to provide a comprehensive removable list with descriptions so that we can completely remove useless ~~features~~ and files that we dont need without breaking the functionalities that we actually want to use.

## Disclaimer
*This is **not** noob-friendly.* I do expect things to break so that you can tell us whats wrong and we will improve this script together.

This script can break things in an unexpected, possibly horrible way. Please do a **full backup** of your current setup before attempting. If anything goes terribly wrong, I wont laugh at you but you will be on your own.
If that disclaimer doesnt scare you, lets proceed.

## Usage
- Comment out anything you do NOT want to remove from the script using #
- Save the script
- Grab a flashable zip and repalce the updater-script inside
- Flash and voil√†

## Feedback
I need your input so that this list can be as complete as possible. If anything other than the removed ones breaks unexpectedly, please check/provide `logcat | grep <some app>`so that we can find out whats wrong. You can do so via XDA thread or submit commits or fork this source and submit a pull request.
